## Follow-on Notes from Day 2

This repo finishes Puppybook, including a lot of code that we didn't get to in our live session. Specifically, take note of:

- The Router written in index.js
- The new ```GET_A_PUPPY``` case in the reducer
- Lines 46-48 of server.js. The server now sends index.html for any routes that don't match (i.e. requests for ```localhost:3000/1```)

For additional practice, take a look at the seed.js left in the root directory of this repo. It's the reference seed file Karen sent you earlier today. Try rewriting your Puppybook backend to match the seed file!
